This paper designs a dual-rotor Bluetooth laser gun turret control system based on STM32. It undergoes continuous substitution and transformation from the first generation to the fourth generation. A 180° limit-position rotor and a 360° continuous rotor are used to construct a dual-degree-of-freedom motion mechanism, and it is controlled by a rotation encoder under the Bluetooth module, enabling remote control and increasing its flexibility. This paper elaborates on the production and upgrade process as well as the design concept.
